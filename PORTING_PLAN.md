## Phase Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Setup & Core Structure
- [x] Initialize Go module: `go mod init github.com/sstent/go-garminconnect`
- [x] Create directory structure
- [x] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Create Makefile with build/test targets
- [x] Add basic README with project overview

### Phase 2: Authentication Implementation
- [x] Implement OAuth2 authentication flow
- [x] Create token storage interface
- [x] Implement session management with auto-refresh
- [x] Handle MFA authentication
- [x] Test against sandbox environment

### Phase 3: API Client Core
- [x] Create Client struct with configuration
- [x] Implement generic request handler
- [x] Add automatic token refresh
- [x] Implement rate limiting
- [x] Set up connection pooling
- [x] Create response parsing utilities

### Phase 4: Endpoint Implementation
#### Health Data Endpoints
